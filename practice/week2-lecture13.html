	<h2>wikipedia: kobe bryant</h2>
	<p id="kobeintro">
		Kobe Bean Bryant was an American professional basketball player. As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
	</p>
	<p class="kobe">
		Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP)

	<h2>Anthony Davis: The Lakers want to win the title for Kobe Bryant</h2>
	<p>
		The Los Angeles Lakers made history last night as they clinched the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference, doing so for the first time in a decade. Anthony Davis brought home the bacon with 40 points on the night, going to work against the Utah Jazz and also getting the walk-off interview with ESPN’s Rachel Nichols. 
	</p>
	<p class="kobe">
		It was during his interview, where he reflected on the significance of the Lakers doing something they haven’t done since the prime days of Kobe Bryant, still so soon after his death earlier this year. LeBron has already spoken on thinking about Kobe every day and Davis did not shy away from the fact that the Lakers want to win the championship this year in Bryant’s honor.
